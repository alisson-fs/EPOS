Segment test
My address space's page directory is located at 0x000000023fdef000
Creating two extra data segments:
Chunk pt 0x00000000800efee7
Chunk pt 0x00000000800efee3
  extra segment 1 => 10000 bytes, done!
  extra segment 2 => 100000 bytes, done!
Attaching segments:
lvl2: 10
lvl1: 1
Attach Return: 0x0000000080200000!!!!
lvl2: 10
lvl1: 2
Attach Return: 0x0000000080400000!!!!
  extra segment 1 => 0x0000000080200000 done!
  extra segment 2 => 0x0000000080400000 done!
Clearing segments:

Deleting segments:  done!
I'm done, bye!
